### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicholas Sacayan,
I am a recent graduate of Cal Poly Pomona, B.S. Computer Science.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my first Software Development/Engineering job out of college!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web-development technologies such as Node, NET, Spring, and Database Systems!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a full-stack app! I prefer back-end work and would love to collaborate with a front-end friend!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with job applications and professional development. Unfortunately I graduated without work experience, so the job hunt has been pretty rough.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-sacayan/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy Unity game development on the side, but I am wary that game development is a difficult industry to get into and can be less than stable.
- Yes I copy/pasted the readme template but hey I think it works great!
